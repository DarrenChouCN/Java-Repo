   * Introduction of QuickSort
   * Assume that partition(A) takes a * length(A) time units and slowsort(A) takes
   * b * length(A)^2 time units. Further assume that the total running time is
   * simply equal to the sum of the running times of all calls to partition() and
   * slowsort(). As seen in the pseudo-code, quicksort does not call itself
   * recursively on lists of length S or less, but instead calls slowsort().
   * 
   * Consider using the randomized quicksort algorithm to sort a list that is some
   * permutation of elements {x | 1 <= x <= listSize}. Hence, the list is of
   * length listSize, only contains integers between 1 and listSize, inclusive,
   * and contains no duplicates. You are given the constants a, b and S, and asked
   * to compute the expected total running time of randomized quicksort on a list
   * of size listSize that obeys the constraints given above.
   * 
   * The question requires compute expected running time, so it is not a D&C
   * question, it is a DP question.
