   * PermutationSignature
   * 
   * The signature of a permutation is a string that is computed as follows: for
   * each pair of consecutive elements of the permutation, write down the letter
   * 'I' (increasing) if the second element is greater than the first one,
   * otherwise write down the letter 'D' (decreasing).
   * 
   * For example, the signature of the permutation {3,1,2,7,4,6,5} is "DIIDID".
   * 
   * Your task is to reverse this computation: You are given a String signature
   * containing the signature of a permutation. Find and return the
   * lexicographically smallest permutation with the given signature. If no such
   * permutation exists, return an empty int[] instead.
